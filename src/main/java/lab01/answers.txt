2.1 - "Prints a String and then terminate the line. This method behaves as though it invokes print(String) and then println()."
The method calls the print(String) method and the println() method.

2.2 - The object "in" represents the "standard" input stream. The type is InputStream.

2.3 - The code would look like below:

String osName = System.getProperty("os.name");
System.out.println(osName);

2.4 - Method overloading is when you have several methods with the same name but take in different parameters.
This is to increase the readability and flexibility of the program.

2.5 - No, the nanoTime() method cannot report the wall-clock time.

2.6 - The package of Scanner class is java.util

2.7 - Yes, you need to explicitly import java.util.Scanner to use it in your program.

2.8 - The sin method takes in radians.
